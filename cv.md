## __About me__
I love JavaScript and magic. Magic is not available to me, so I'm studying for a front-end developer.


I am independent and proactive, I know how to argue my point of view.
I have the skills of self-organization and self-discipline, planning and managing priorities of tasks, searching and analyzing new information for myself, skills of working on mistakes.
